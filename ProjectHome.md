McSimA+ is a timing simulation infrastructure that models x86-based asymmetric manycore microarchitectures in detail for both core and uncore subsystems, including a full spectrum of asymmetric cores from single-threaded to multithreaded and from in-order to out-of-order, sophisticated cache hierarchies, coherence hardware, on-chip interconnects, memory controllers, and main memory.
